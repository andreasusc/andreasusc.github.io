<!-- ### Abstract

This paper analyzes how giving consumers control over their personal data
affects market outcomes. When consumers have perfect knowledge of their product
valuations, data ownership paradoxically makes them worse off - firms can
perfectly price discriminate and consumers receive no compensation. However,
when consumers are uncertain about their own valuations, partial data disclosure
can emerge, potentially benefiting some consumers through compensation. The
welfare effects of privacy regulations thus depend critically on consumer
uncertainty and firms' ability to make inferences from both disclosed and
undisclosed information. -->

<!-- ### Abstract

This paper examines how a mediator can improve efficiency in data markets by
decorrelating consumer data before sharing it with platforms. The key insight is
that data externalities arise when consumer types are correlated, allowing
platforms to infer information about non-sharing consumers from those who share.
By transforming the data to remove correlations, the mediator can eliminate
these externalities and improve consumer welfare. -->

<h2 id="simulating-bitcoin-mining">Simulating Bitcoin mining</h2>
<!-- ### Abstract

This paper examines how different Bitcoin mining strategies affect profitability
and network dynamics through a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.
The model incorporates time explicitly to evaluate mining policies' true
profitability, addressing limitations of previous block-domain approaches that
ignore temporal aspects. -->
