        <p>In this post I will make the case that giving consumers, so-called property
rights over their personal data is not in their best interest. That is,
consumers will be worse off in the presence of some kind of technology that
allows them to sell or seek compensation for their personal information in a
market. The argument will make use of the notion of “equilibrium” which is a
term economists use to address the situation where a lot of people are making a
decision at the same time. So while the individual consumer might benefit from
having rights to their own data, when <em>all</em> consumers are given this right,
<em>all</em> consumers will be worse off, or at least that will be the argument.</p>
<h3 id="the-game">The game</h3>
<p>Consider a market for a good and, to simulate a large number of people, let each
consumers’s personal valuation for the good be distributed on the continuum
<span class="math inline">[0, 1]</span> such that the total number of people have a <em>mass</em> of <span class="math inline">1</span>. To be more
precise, the valuation, <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>, of every consumer is distributed according to the
CDF <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>. The market is served by monopolist who aims to maximize it’s profit in
the market. In the standard case the monopolist knows <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> and thus sets the
price, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>, that solves</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$ p^M = \frac{f(p)}{1-F(p)} $$</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose instead that, before trade, every consumer has the option to sell its
personal valuation to the monopolist. That is, the consumer either sells
information or does not. The information is verifiable, meaning the consumer
has no option to lie or to only partially reveal their information. The
monopolist can then use the information during trade to offer personalized
prices to consumers. The timing is as follows</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The monopolist offers a uniform (across consumers) price, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> ≥ 0</span>, for
consumer information</li>
<li>Every consumer decides whether or not to sell</li>
<li>The monopolist uses the information to offer personalized prices <span class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>v</em>)</span> to
consumers who sell information and offers a uniform price <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> to all consumers
who choose not to sell.</li>
</ol>
<p>The equilibrium concept used in this kind of game is <em>Perfect Bayesian
Equilibrium</em> (PBE). Since the decision of each consumer to sell or not may be
informative about their valuation, in equilibrium, the monopolist has to form a
belief about what kind of consumer is choosing not to sell information. In turn,
the belief has to match the actual distribution of consumers, which shows the
nature of an equilibrium as a kind of stability condition.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>
<p>The unique solution to the game, that is, the unique PBE, is for the monopolist
to offer <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 0</span> and for <em>all</em> consumers to sell their information. The monopolist
sets <span class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>v</em>) = <em>v</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 1</span>. Clearly the equilibrium is very bad for consumers, as
they are both (a) perfectly price discriminated against and (b) not
compensated for the data they sell. So how can this be?</p>
<p>First notice that the <em>marginal consumer</em>, with valuation <span class="math inline"><em>v̂</em></span>, who is
indifferent between selling and not selling, satisfies</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>r</em> = <em>v̂</em> − <em>p</em></span>.</p>
<p>Here the LHS is the surplus from selling and the RHS is the surplus from not
selling and facing <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> in the product market (remaining anonymous). Clearly,
given <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>, for any consumer with <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> ≤ <em>v̂</em></span> it is optimal to sell.
The valuation of the marginal consumer, <span class="math inline"><em>v̂</em></span>, then acts as a cut-off where
all consumers with a higher valuation do not sell and remain anonymous. Thus,
given a cut-off, <span class="math inline"><em>v̂</em></span>, the monopolist sets an optimal price, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> ≥ <em>v̂</em></span>. So, suppose that the monopolist sets <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> &gt; 0</span> in the first stage. Then
the marginal consumer gets no payoff from not selling but a strictly positive
payoff from selling. This precludes the existence of a marginal consumer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is clear that the above proposed equilibrium is in fact an
equilibrium where no one has an incentive to deviate. If every consumer sells
data, the monopolist can form any belief it wants about a consumer who does not
sell data, since on the equilibrium path, this is a probability zero event. Thus
choosing the belief <span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = 1</span> with probability <span class="math inline">1</span> for a non-selling consumer, the
optimal price is <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 1</span>. In this case, any consumer who deviates to not selling
gets a payoff of zero, which makes the deviation non-profitable.</p>
<p>Finally, one might wonder if there is an equilibrium where no consumer sells
data and the monopolist sets the monopolist price <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sup><em>M</em></sup></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>r</em> = 0</span>. But this is not an equilibrium since it is not stable. The monopolist can
profitably deviate to raising the price, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>, and having the lower segment, who
do not trade at price <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sup><em>M</em></sup></span>, sell their data. The proposed
equilibrium is thus unique.</p>
