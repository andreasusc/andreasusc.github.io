title: A market for consumer information
---

In this post I will make the case that giving consumers, so called, property
rights over their personal data is not in their best interest. That is,
consumers will be worse off in the presence of some kind of technology that
allows them to sell or seek compensation for their personal information in a
market. The argument will make use of the notion of “equilibrium” which is a
term economists use to address the situation where a lot of people are making a
decision at the same time. So while the individual consumer might benefit from
having rights to their own data, when *all* consumers are given this right,
*all* consumers will be worse off, or at least that will be the argument.

Consider a market for a good and, to simulate a large number of people, let each
individuals personal valuation for the good be distributed on the continuum
$[0, 1]$ such that the total number of people have a *mass* of $1$. To be more
precise, the valuation, $v$, of every individual is distributed according to the
CDF $F$. The market is served by monopolist who aims to maximize it’s profit in
the market. In the standard case the monopolist knows $F$ and thus sets the
price, $p$, that solves

$$ p = \frac{f(p)}{1-F(p)} $$
